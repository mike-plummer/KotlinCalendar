# KotlinCalendar
Implementation of a personal calendar as a demonstration of Kotlin grammar and features

**_Note:_** This is still a work in progress.

## Setup
This project relies on a Kotlin runtime. There are plugins for IntelliJ and Eclipse or you can just get the command-line version. All of these are available at [KotlinLang.org](https://kotlinlang.org).
