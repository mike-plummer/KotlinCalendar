# KotlinCalendar
Implementation of a personal calendar as a demonstration of Kotlin grammar and features

**_Note:_** This is still a work in progress.

## Setup
The preferred method for running this project is Gradle. Just run `gradle` from project root which will by default compile and launch the main class

There are several other options available to you if you prefer to not use Gradle:
 * IntelliJ
 * Eclipse
 * Command Line

Information and downloads for these are available @ [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org).
